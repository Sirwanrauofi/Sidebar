# Sidebar
This code snippet demonstrates how to toggle the visibility of a sidebar in a web page using JavaScript. It defines a function toggleSidebar that either shows or hides the sidebar by adding or removing a class (show-sidebar). The visibility is controlled through two event listeners attached to buttons: one (sidebar-toggle) to toggle the sidebar's visibility and another (close-btn) specifically to hide it. This approach uses the classList method with actions like 'toggle' and 'remove' to dynamically adjust the sidebar's CSS class, affecting its display state.
